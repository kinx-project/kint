The kinT keyboard controller is a replacement for your Kinesis Advantage or
Advantage 2 ergonomic keyboards.

You can use it for example…

* to build or modify your own keyboard
* to [work around bugs in the standard controller](https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2013-03-21-kinesis_custom_controller/)
* because you prefer to run open source software such as the [QMK firmware](https://docs.qmk.fm/), even on your keyboard

## Building your own kinT keyboard controller

1. Follow [“Buying the board and components (Bill of
   materials)”](https://github.com/kinx-project/kint#buying-the-board-and-components-bill-of-materials). When
   ordering from OSH Park (board) and Digi-Key (components), you’ll get the
   minimum quantity of 3 boards for 72 USD (24 USD per board), and one set of
   components for 49 USD.

   * If you have any special requirements regarding which Teensy microcontroller
     to use, this is the step where you would replace the Teensy 3.6 with your
     choice.

1. Wait for the components to arrive. When ordering from big shops like Digi-Key
   or Mouser, this typically takes 2 days to many places in the world.

1. Wait for the boards to arrive. This takes 6 days in the best case when
   ordering from OSH Park with their Super Swift Service option. In general, the
   longer you are willing to wait, the cheaper it is going to get.

1. Follow [the soldering
   guide](https://github.com/kinx-project/kint#soldering). This will take about
   an hour.

1. [Install the firmware](https://github.com/kinx-project/kint#installing-the-firmware)

## Why use the kinT instead of the older replacement board?

* The kinT supports both, the older Kinesis Advantage (KB500) **and** the newer
  Kinesis Advantage 2 (KB600) keyboards. They differ in how the thumb pads are
  connected. See the soldering instructions below.

   * NOTE: If this is the *only* feature you’re interested in, and you already
     have a custom keyboard controller for your older Kinesis, [check out the
     u6w5 adapter
     board](https://github.com/kinx-project/adapter-use-kb600-with-kb500-controller)
     I made!

* The kinT is made for the newer Teensy 3.x and 4.x series, which will remain
  widely available for years to come, whereas the [Teensy++ 2.0 is
  discontinued](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensypp.html).

* The kinT is a smaller PCB (4.25 x 3.39 inches, or 108.0 x 86.1 mm), which makes it:

   * more compact: can be inserted/removed without having to unscrew a key well.

   * cheaper: 72 USD for 3 boards at oshpark, instead of 81 USD.

* The kinT silkscreen
  ([front](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kinx-project/kint/44e6c8be96a0e1e13ada5eafdeba8c51a2d6c9e8/pcb-3d-render-front-v2020-06-23.png),
  [back](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kinx-project/kint/44e6c8be96a0e1e13ada5eafdeba8c51a2d6c9e8/pcb-3d-render-back-v2020-06-23.png))
  and
  [schematic](https://github.com/kinx-project/kint/blob/44e6c8be96a0e1e13ada5eafdeba8c51a2d6c9e8/schematic-v2020-06-23.pdf)
  are much much clearer, making assembly a breeze.

* The kinT is a good starting point for your own project:

   * kinT was designed in the open source [KiCad](https://kicad.org/)
     program, meaning you do not need any license subscriptions.

   * The clear silkscreen and schematic make development and debugging easier.

* On the kinT, the Teensy no longer has to be soldered onto the board upside down.

* On the kinT, the FPC connectors have been moved for less strain on the cables.

* The kinT makes possible lower-cost builds: if you don’t need the scroll lock,
  num lock and keypad LEDs, you can use a Teensy LC for merely 11 USD.

## Compatibility: which Teensy to use?

The kinT keyboard controller was made for the Teensy 3.x and 4.x series of
devices, which are ARM based.

The older Atmel based Teensy++ 2.0 are also supported, but require slightly more
complicated soldering: not connecting a few clashing Teensy++ 2.0 pins and
closing 3 soldering jumpers.

Which Teensy should you buy for your build? Here are a few considerations:

* I have been using the Teensy 4.1 for many months without problems.

* I used the Teensy 3.6 for multiple years, and many others are happy with it,
  too.

* The Teensy++ 2.0 used to be the most popular choice, in part because it was
  the only option with the the predecessor keyboard controller. The [Teensy++
  2.0 is discontinued](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensypp.html), so I would no
  longer recommend it for new keyboard builds.

* If you are an advanced user of the QMK firmware, note that despite QMK working
  on the Teensy 3.6, [some features are not yet
  ported/working](https://github.com/kinx-project/kint/issues/10). As QMK was
  originally made for AVR micro controllers, you will likely find best overall
  QMK feature availability with the older Teensy++ 2.0.

## Buying the board and components (Bill of materials)

To buy the board, you can:

* [order the kinT controller from OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/YSZAuKc0) starting at 72 USD
* [order the kinT controller from Aisler](https://aisler.net/p/JQIIIJSL) starting at 18 EUR
* [order the kinT controller from JLCPCB](https://github.com/kinx-project/kint/tree/master/gerbers/jlcpcb)
* or upload the [kint.kicad_pcb
  file](https://github.com/kinx-project/kint/blob/master/kicad/kint.kicad_pcb)
  to the manufacturing service you prefer.

To buy the components, check out the [kinT BOM in the Octopart BOM
tool](https://octopart.com/bom-tool/4AnOAR3f), from where you can conveniently
buy all components via Digi-Key or Mouser.

For your convenience, this is the full BOM (links go to Octopart):

| Part Number                                                                               | Count | Cost   | Description               | Note                                               |

Note: with all parts (except for the Molex 39-53-2135 FPC connector), there is
no need to get the specific versions from the BOM above — if you have LEDs,
resistors and pin headers still lying around from other projects, feel free to
re-use them!

## Soldering

All the soldering connections on the kinT keyboard controller are easy to make,
so the whole assembly can be done at home, with a cheap soldering iron and basic
electronic hobby equipment. A build takes about 1 hour of time and involves a
little over 100 soldering connections.

For example, I used the [Miniware TS100 soldering
iron](https://hackaday.com/2017/07/24/review-ts100-soldering-iron/), which can
be found for 50-60 EUR or USD.

If you’re new to soldering, check out [this excellent soldering reference card
from adafruit](https://twitter.com/zekjur/status/952596267884056576).

You can also [watch me solder a kinT keyboard controller on live
stream](https://youtu.be/I0kwQbnhlfk?t=5880) (from 1:38:00 to 3:33:53). The
process can be done in under an hour if you’re not talking to a live audience at
the same time :-). I want to add an edited and higher-quality video, too.

### Soldering instructions for the Teensy 3.x or 4.x

1. Populate the FPC connectors J2, J3, J4, J7 (all keyboards) and J1, J8 for the
   newer Advantage 2 (KB600). Turn the board around and solder all their pins.

1. Solder resistors R1, R2, R3, R4 and the four LEDs onto the board.

   * LEDs are directional parts! Their marker marks the cathode, which is
     labeled as C on the kinT. For details about the marker, refer to the LED
     datasheet, e.g. the [Kingbright APT3216QBC/D data
     sheet](https://www.kingbrightusa.com/images/catalog/SPEC/APT3216QBC-D.pdf)
     if you are using the LED from the [Bill of Materials
     (BOM)](#buying-the-board-and-components-bill-of-materials).

   * If you’re new to SMD (Surface Mount Devices) soldering, check out [How to
     Hand Solder SMD](http://www.davidhaillant.com/smd-soldering/), which
     explains what I call the “One pad at a time” method.

1. Turn the board around and place (but don’t solder) **3 rows of pin headers**
   (top, bottom, vertical) in the Teensy holes.

   * The vertical pin header is required for powering the LEDs.

1. Place your Teensy 3.x or 4.x on top of the pin header and solder all its pins.

   * If you’re using a Teensy++ 2.0, you must not connect some pins! [See the
     instructions below](#soldering-instructions-for-the-teensy-20).

1. Turn the board around and solder all the pin header pins.

1. For the older Advantage (KB500) keyboard, populate pin headers J5, J6 and
   solder their pins.

### Soldering instructions for the Teensy++ 2.0

Follow the [instructions for the Teensy 3.x or 4.x
above](#soldering-instructions-for-the-teensy-3x-or-4x), but:

1. Do not connect pin 7, pin 15 and pin 16. These are marked with an x on the kinT.

   * An easy way to do this is to remove the corresponding pins from your pin
     header with pliers.

2. Close the solder jumpers JP1, JP2, JP3. These will remap pin 7, pin 15 and
   pin 16 onto pins that can be used with the Teensy++ 2.0.

## Installing the firmware

You can use the QMK Configurator online build tool to compile the QMK firmware for
your kinT keyboard controller, or customize your layout.

Alternatively, you can install the pre-built, tested firmware file (default QMK
keymap and settings) we offer, for example to test whether issues are related to
your self-compiled firmware.

You can install these .hex files with the [Teensy
Loader](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader.html).

To compile your own firmware, see [QMK: Get
Started](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/?id=get-started) and refer to the [full Teensy
compatibility chart](#reference-full-teensy-compatibility-chart) above to find
the QMK branch to work with.

## Debugging / Troubleshooting

### General technique: highlight connections in KiCad

1. Install [KiCad](https://kicad.org/) (free and open source)
1. Clone https://github.com/kinx-project/kint/ and open `kicad/kint.pro` in KiCad
1. Select `Tools` → `Edit PCB`
1. Select `View` → `Flip Board View`, because the front side of kinT contains the LEDs, the back side contains the connectors.
1. Select `Highlight Net`, the second icon from the top in the right icon bar
1. Click on the pin of interest. In the bottom left, you’ll see the Net Name (e.g. `COL_3`), and KiCad will highlight all connected traces.

### Issue: LEDs not working

See also [Example issue #13](https://github.com/kinx-project/kint/issues/13) for
a full debugging walk-through.

* Check the orientation of your LEDs, as they are directional parts.

   * The marker printed on the kinT board marks the LED cathode, which is
     labeled as C on the kinT. For details about the marker, refer to the LED
     datasheet, e.g. the [Kingbright APT3216QBC/D data
     sheet](https://www.kingbrightusa.com/images/catalog/SPEC/APT3216QBC-D.pdf)
     if you are using the LED from the [Bill of Materials
     (BOM)](#buying-the-board-and-components-bill-of-materials).

* If your Teensy is not soldered yet (or removed from its socket), you can test your LEDs with a multimeter:
   * switch your multimeter to diode test mode
   * place the black probe (`COM`) on e.g. Teensy pin 12 (`LED_CAPS_LOCK`)
   * place the red probe on the anode (A) of your LED
   * the LED should light up now, or it might be defective:
   ![IMG_0755](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55506/91949423-6811c780-ed00-11ea-8393-5f79e4586825.JPG)

* Measure that the LED pins behave as expected, e.g. Teensy pin 12 for `LED_CAPS_LOCK`:
   * you should measure 3.3V when the LED is turned off
   * you should measure 0V when the LED is turned on
   ![schematic_000](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55506/91944490-7232c680-ecfe-11ea-90e4-071a66173f0d.jpg)

* Check that you soldered in the vertical pin header, which supplies 3.3V to the LEDs:
